Here is the challenge as written by Jerry Bogedain <jerry.bogedain@virtuix.com> to me on May 23, 2024:


Attached lyric.zip is
 the starting point for the test exercise. The app currently allows the user to enter an artist and song title and it will return the longest word in the song's lyrics.  

 

What you need to do is modify the app in the following ways: 


    Present the user with an option to process longest word or most used word.  

    Modify the output to present the word (longest or most used based on the user's choice) and the definition of the word. The definition can be found by using this API:
    https://dictionaryapi.dev 

    Filter out articles, propositions, and interjections so they cannot be selected.  

    You can add user feedback where appropriate, and error handling of major error states (no error handling exists right now). 


 

You can refactor everything however you want to.  

 

If you run into any issues, or have any questions, please email me. Especially if the requirements are not clear. I tend to watch my email into the night.  

 

Thanks, 

Jerry
